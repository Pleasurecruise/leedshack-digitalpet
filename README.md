## Background Information

At Genio (formerly Glean) we envision a world where every person has the tools and
confidence to expand what’s possible through learning. We believe this happens
when you equip, empower, and encourage learners with courses to develop study
skills, and tools that put knowledge into action, unlocking better learning.
Trusted by over 1,000 institutions, Genio Notes makes classroom learning more
effective for students of all abilities, and is now paired with an engaging course to
boost study skills. Genio Present helps students gain presentation confidence
through structured rehearsal, self-reflection, actionable feedback, and visible
growth.
